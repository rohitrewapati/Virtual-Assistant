# Virtual-Assistant
virtual assistant that can carry out numerous activities by itself. I have incorporated a number of libraries, including speechRecognition, gTTS, pyttsx3, playsound, and others, into this project.

We can use this Virtual Assistant to search for anything on Google using voice commands rather than typing, to search on YouTube, to open various social media websites, and so on.
